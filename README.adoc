==== CAUTION: This is using link:https://cloud.google.com/translate/#premium-edition-beta[Google CLOUD TRANSLATION API Premium Edition], but it is still beta. Therefore, users have to get API key from Google after the users by filling the form. That's WHY I didn't publish on Chrome Web Store yet.

If you have API key:

1. Download [the released file] and extract it.
2. In link:chrome://extensions/[] of your Chrome, click `load unpacked extension` and pick above folder. (You have to turn on developer mode)
1. Click options of this extension, enter your API key and choose your language which translates to.

Now, you can see a translation button on GitHub.
